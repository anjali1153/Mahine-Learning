# Machine Learning Models – Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
## Project Overview
- This project focuses on Machine Learning fundamentals, covering:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Regression Models
4. Linear Regression (Simple & Multiple)
- The goal is to understand how different machine learning models work and how they are applied to real-world datasets.

## What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1.Supervised Learning
- Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data (input + output).

2. Unsupervised Learning
- Unsupervised learning is used when the data is unlabeled (no output column).

  ### Regression Models:
  - What is Regression?
    --> Regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict continuous numerical values.

  #### Linear Regression Model
  - Linear Regression is a regression algorithm that shows a linear relationship between input and output variables.
  - Mathematical Equation :  y = mX + c
  - Where:
    y = dependent variable
    X = independent variable
    m = slope
    c = intercept

  1. Simple Linear Regression
  - Simple Linear Regression uses one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.

  2. Multiple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression uses more than one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.
  - Equatioon :   y = m1X1 + m2X2 + m3X3 + c
 
  ## Tools & Technologies Used:
  1. Python
  2. NumPy
  3. Pandas
  4. Matplotlib
  5. Scikit-learn
 
  ## Dataset:
1. CSV format dataset used for training and testing
2. Data preprocessing steps applied before model training

## Project Objective:
1. Understand core machine learning concepts
2. Implement regression models
3. Compare simple and multiple linear regression
4. Gain hands-on experience with real datasets

## Conclusion:
- This project provides a strong foundation in machine learning basics, focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning with an in-depth understanding of linear regression models.
